# seinfeld
A minimal CLI productivity tracker, inspired by [that one productivity tip from Seinfeld](https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626).
It's unfinished, and barely usable - oh, and it's also my first "proper" ruby project, so don't expect the code to be any good either.

(also, while writing this readme, i've realized that there's already a very similar gem with the same name. whoopsie)

## Installation
after cloning, go into the dir and

    $ rake install

## Usage
    $ seinfeld mark habit1
    
    # meant to be used as the shell greeting
    $ seinfeld compact
	*habit1 13	habit2 12
